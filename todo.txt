to do:
make webpage more interesting
develop actual site, add the money thing
make webpage public
add logout button

-add session
-close session
make user object?
make it so if you try to type in auth.php link without any information that it will kick you out

sanitize input - only x ascii range
hash info
-make it so that users cant just change the link and access random things
-?ensure session security, still vulnerable to session hijacking
send balance from auth.php to mysite.php with aes
change perms on files accordingly
validate data so user cant just add money to account
